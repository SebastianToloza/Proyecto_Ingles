            <h2>Adjectives</h2>
            <p>Adjectives are words that describe or qualify a noun, providing more information about its characteristics. Adjectives can indicate qualities such as color, size, shape, quantity, etc.</p>
        
            <h3>Types of Adjectives</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Descriptive Adjectives:</strong> These describe a quality of the noun. Example: <strong>beautiful</strong>, <strong>tall</strong>.</li>
                <li><strong>Possessive Adjectives:</strong> These indicate possession or belonging. Example: <strong>my</strong>, <strong>their</strong>.</li>
                <li><strong>Demonstrative Adjectives:</strong> These point to something specific. Example: <strong>this</strong>, <strong>those</strong>.</li>
            </ul>
        
            <h3>Position of Adjectives</h3>
            <p>In English, adjectives generally come before the noun they describe.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Example:</strong> <strong>She has a beautiful house.</strong></li>
            </ul>
            <p>However, in some cases, adjectives can follow the verb "to be" or other linking verbs.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Example:</strong> <strong>The house is beautiful.</strong></li>
            </ul>
        
            <h3>Examples of Adjectives in Different Structures</h3>
        
            <h4>Affirmative</h4>
            <p>In affirmative sentences, adjectives directly describe or qualify the noun.</p>

            <h2>Verb Tenses</h2>
            <p>Understanding verb tenses is essential to communicating effectively in English. Here are the main verb tenses:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Present Simple:</strong> Describes regular actions or general truths. (e.g., I work every day.)</li>
                <li><strong>Present Continuous:</strong> Describes actions happening right now. (e.g., She is studying.)</li>
                <li><strong>Past Simple:</strong> Describes completed actions in the past. (e.g., They visited yesterday.)</li>
                <li><strong>Past Continuous:</strong> Describes actions that were in progress at a certain time in the past. (e.g., He was reading when I called.)</li>
                <li><strong>Future Simple:</strong> Describes actions that will happen. (e.g., I will go to the store tomorrow.)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Each of these tenses can be used in different contexts to give more meaning to the action being described.</p>

            <h2>Conditional Sentences</h2>
            <p>Conditional sentences express situations that could happen (or could have happened) depending on a condition. There are several types:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>First Conditional:</strong> Refers to real, possible situations (If + present, will + verb). Example: If it rains, we will stay inside.</li>
                <li><strong>Second Conditional:</strong> Refers to hypothetical situations (If + past simple, would + verb). Example: If I had a million dollars, I would travel the world.</li>
                <li><strong>Third Conditional:</strong> Refers to past hypothetical situations (If + past perfect, would have + verb). Example: If I had studied harder, I would have passed the exam.</li>

            <h3>Superlatives:</h3>
            <p>Superlatives are used to compare three or more things. The basic structure is:</p>

            <h2>Past Participle</h2>
            <p>The past participle is a verb form primarily used in perfect tenses and in the passive voice. It is the third form of the verb, and it is usually used with the auxiliary verbs <strong>have</strong> or <strong>be</strong>.</p>
        
            <h3>Formation of the Past Participle:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>For regular verbs, the past participle is formed by adding <strong>-ed</strong> to the base verb. Example: <strong>play</strong> → <strong>played</strong>.</li>
                <li>For irregular verbs, the past participle may vary. Example: <strong>go</strong> → <strong>gone</strong>.</li>
            </ul>

            <pre>Subject + was/were + verb-ing</pre>
