            <h2>Verb to Be</h2>
            <p>The verb "to be" is one of the most important verbs in English. It is used to express states of being, identity, and characteristics. The forms of the verb "to be" are:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>I am</li>
                <li>You are</li>
                <li>He/She/It is</li>
                <li>We are</li>

                <li>They are</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Examples:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>I am happy.</li>
                <li>She is a teacher.</li>

        <div id="verb-tense" class="section">
            <h2>Verb Tenses</h2>
            <p>Understanding verb tenses is essential to communicating effectively in English. Here are the main verb tenses:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Present Simple:</strong> Describes regular actions or general truths. (e.g., I work every day.)</li>
                <li><strong>Present Continuous:</strong> Describes actions happening right now. (e.g., She is studying.)</li>
                <li><strong>Past Simple:</strong> Describes completed actions in the past. (e.g., They visited yesterday.)</li>
                <li><strong>Past Continuous:</strong> Describes actions that were in progress at a certain time in the past. (e.g., He was reading when I called.)</li>
                <li><strong>Future Simple:</strong> Describes actions that will happen. (e.g., I will go to the store tomorrow.)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Each of these tenses can be used in different contexts to give more meaning to the action being described.</p>

        <div id="conditional-sentences" class="section">
            <h2>Conditional Sentences</h2>
            <p>Conditional sentences express situations that could happen (or could have happened) depending on a condition. There are several types:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>First Conditional:</strong> Refers to real, possible situations (If + present, will + verb). Example: If it rains, we will stay inside.</li>
                <li><strong>Second Conditional:</strong> Refers to hypothetical situations (If + past simple, would + verb). Example: If I had a million dollars, I would travel the world.</li>
                <li><strong>Third Conditional:</strong> Refers to past hypothetical situations (If + past perfect, would have + verb). Example: If I had studied harder, I would have passed the exam.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Examples:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>She is taller than him.</li>
                <li>This book is more interesting than that one.</li>
                <li>My house is bigger than yours.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Superlatives:</h3>
            <p>Superlatives are used to compare three or more things. The basic structure is:</p>
            <pre>Adjective + est / most + adjective</pre>
